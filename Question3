'''Actual Volatility
     This is the measure of the amount of randomness in an asset return at any particular time. It is very difficult to measure, but is supposed to be an input into all option pricing models.
• There is no ‘timescale’ associated with actual volatility; it is a quantity that exists at each instant, possibly 
varying from moment to moment.
Historical Volatility
    This is a measure of the amount of randomness over some period in the past. The period is always specified, and so 
    is the mathematical method for its calculation. Sometimes this backward-looking measure is used as an estimate for 
    what volatility will be in the future.
    • There are two ‘timescales’ associated with historical volatility: one short, and one long.
Example: The 60-day volatility using daily returns. Perhaps of interest if you are pricing a 60-day option, which you are hedging daily.In pricing an option we are making an estimate of what actual volatility will be over the lifetime of the option. After the option has expired we can go back and calculate what the volatility actually was over the life of the option.

  Example: I sold a 30-day option for a 30% volatility, I hedged it every day. Did I make money?
Implied Volatility
The implied volatility is the volatility which when input into the Black–Scholes option pricing formulae gives the       market price of the option. It is often described as the market’s view of the future actual volatility over the lifetime of the particular option. However, it is also influenced by other effects such as supply and demand. 
• There is one ‘timescale’ associated with implied volatility: expiration.
Stochastic Volatility
refers to the fact that the volatility of asset prices varies and is not constant, as is assumed in the Black Scholes options pricing model. Stochastic volatility modeling attempts to correct for this problem with Black Scholes by allowing volatility to fluctuate over time.'''

''' Black–Scholes model
    - The Black–Scholes formula gives a theoretical estimate of the price of European-style options and shows that the option has a unique price given the risk of the security and its expected to return.

''' Finite difference methods
    - Finite difference methods are used to price options by approximating the differential equation that describes how an option price evolves over time by
      a set of (discrete-time) difference equations.
    - This method can solve derivative pricing problems that have, in general, the same level of complexity as those problems solved by tree approaches,but,
      given their relative complexity, are usually employed only when other approaches are inappropriate.
      At the same time, like tree-based methods, this approach is limited in terms of the number of underlying variables, and for problems with Monte Carlo methods for option pricing are usually preferred.

''' Monte Carlo methods
    - Monte Carlo option model uses Monte Carlo methods[Notes 1] to calculate the value of an option with multiple sources of uncertainty or with complicated features. 
    - Monte Carlo Methods are particularly useful in the valuation of options with multiple sources of uncertainty or with complicated features, which would make them difficult to value 
      through a straightforward Black–Scholes-style or lattice based computation.
    - The technique is thus widely used in valuing path dependent structures like lookback- and Asian options and in real options analysis.Additionally, as above, 
      the modeller is not limited as to the probability distribution assumed.
    - If an analytical technique for valuing the option exists—or even a numeric technique, such as a (modified) pricing tree—Monte Carlo methods will usually be too slow to be competitive.

# Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_methods_for_option_pricing
# From these 3 models,In my opinion I think the 1st model;Black Scholes model; is the best model.Because,it gives the highest put pricing value.
# The value of 2nd models,I think the value is over.
